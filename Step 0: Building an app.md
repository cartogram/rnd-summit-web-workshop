## Introduction

Hello and welcome to the Rnd Summmit Web Workshop. Let's start by doing introductions around the room. Everyone state your name, the city you live in, role at Shopify and favorite Shopify snack.

_(Organizers take part in this as well)_

## Workshop Goals

Now that we all know eachother a bit better, let's go over what we are going to cover today.

1.  Introduce you a number of foundational principles and best practises for web development at Shopify.
2.  Demonstrate some new tools we've been working on help get you productive quickly.
3.  Expose you to different parts of the Web stack (Typescript, GraphQL, Testing, Polaris), giving you a base understanding of their individual purpose as well as how they work together.

### What is Webgen?

The Webgen (working title) is a tool we built initally for RnD Summit to help developers scaffold code quickly and easily. The tool currently supports new Apps and Components with limited options, but it has ambitious goals and hopes to automate everything from Polaris component forks to hack-days projects to third-party developers looking to jump start their Shopify app idea. We hope this will both enforce enforce and serve educate developers, much like we are doing today, on our best practises of Web development.

### What Best Practises?

The Web Foundations team has created a living guide for how we build web UI at Shopify. This is a single Github repo that captures the principles used to make decisions, best practices and styleguides for writing UI code. We are going to put many of these foundations into practise today.

### What are we going to build?

Today we are going go step by step and build a simple Customer management Shopify app that uses GraphQL to query and mutate data from the Shopify Admin GraphQL API.

Let's get started!
