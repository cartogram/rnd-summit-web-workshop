# New Section (20 min)

## Adding a new Route and Component

Now that we have our basic app scaffold, lets build out a new section for our Customers routes. Make sure your dev server is running at this point. 

The first thing we are going to do is create a new folder under `app/sections`, call this folder `Customers`.

Now, in your terminal, type `yarn create component CustomerIndex`. When you run this commnad, it will provide for you a list of possible places you can generate this component.

No, we will not require graphql.
No, we do not need css.

There are three main type of components that we typically build with React, Pure Component (pure), Stateless Functional Component (function), and Component (class). Stateless Funcational Components, is just a function that takes arguments (props) and returns markup (JSX). They do not have state and generally pretty simple: lovingly referred to as "dumb". Next we have Pure and Class Components. These are the basic building block of a Class that you extend from the React the library, they are stateful, can use the React lifecycle events and usually more complex than Stateless Functinal Components. In most cases, you want to use a Pure Component over a Class Components because they are more performant. React components re-render themselves when their props or state change, this can be an expensive operation, and we want to limit the times this happens to only when we need it. Pure components will re-render less often because they use shallow comparison of their props and state.

So in this case, let's go with the pure component with is the default.

Now if you go into your `sections/Customer` folder, you should see a CustomerIndex component that has been scaffolded out for you. With a index, tests folder and `CustomerIndex.tsx` component file. 

In the `section/Customer/index.ts` this is the file you will use to import the components in this section with their appropriate routes. Let's copy and paste the contents of `Sectiongs/Home/index.tsx`. In the future, the Webgen should take care of this for you. Rename all of the `Home` to `Customer` (you can use `CMD` + `D` to help).

Go into `section/index.tsx` and export the Customers section from this file.

Next go to the `app/foundation/routes` file and add a new route. Copy and past the base route of the application and change the `Home` component to `Customer` instead. Remove the `exact` prop, rename the path to `/customers` and the component to the `Customers` component we just generated, import this component as well.

Now if you go to `localhost:8081/customers`, you will see this component being rendered. It just says "CustomerIndex" as that is the default from Webgen.

What question do you have?

## Adding Polaris components

Now that we have our page at our desired route, let's bring in Polaris and make it look better. Let's look back at our mock up on Invision.

**Invision Link:** https://invis.io/4DN0ENNZMGA#/309239104

We can see a list of customers with some avatars and a Page with a title. In Polaris, we convienently have a Page component. Head to [polaris.shopify.com](polaris.shopify.com) and search for Page.

Copy and paste the code snippet and paste it into our `CustomerIndex.tsx` page. When you save, prettier should take care of most of the formmating errors except that Page is not defined. We need to import it from polaris.

Add `import {Page} from '@shopify/polaris'` to the top of the page. Note, Webgen has taken care of installing this for us when we generated our app.

Delete all the props other than `title`, change this to `Customers` and refresh the page. You should see a Page with the title `Customers`. Sweet.

Next we need a `ResourceList` so head back to [polaris.shopify.com](polaris.shopify.com), search `ResourceList` and copy and paste the code snippet again. Paste it inside the `Page` component as its children.

We first need to import the new components. Make the following changes.

```diff

-import {Page} from '@shopify/polaris'
+import {Page, ResourceList, Card, Avatar, TextStyle} from '@shopify/polaris'
```

We still have one error on our renderItem prop, we will resolve this by adding a new private function for this prop. Underneath our render function, add a new private method and copy and paste the body of the inline function to this private method.

```
private renderItem(item: any) {
  const {id, url, name, location} = item;
  const media = <Avatar customer size="medium" name={name} />;
  return (
    <ResourceList.Item
      id={id}
      url={url}
      media={media}
      accessibilityLabel={`View details for ${name}`}
    >
      <h3>
        <TextStyle variation="strong">{name}</TextStyle>
      </h3>
      <div>{location}</div>
    </ResourceList.Item>
  );
}
```

Next change the `renderItem` prop to use this method.

```diff
-renderItem={(item) => {
+renderItem={this.renderItem}
```

You should now see the customer list being rendered on the page.

Let's talk about the `any` type we added to this private method. We need this because of Typescript. Who has used typescript before?

Can anyone explain it?

Typescript is a static typing language where the type of the variables is known at runtime. This is the reason why when I change the type to `any`, the compile time error went away. Typescript is completely optional, but by adding either `ts` or `tsx` extension to your file you are opting to use it for that file. You will often find `.d.ts` files in a Typescript app. These are seperate Typescript definitions that typeically live next to a javascript.

I heard many people say "Typescript is difficult to ramp up", but it also common for them to change their mind to "I cannot live with out it" after only a few weeks of using it. Here are a few we love about Typescript.

* Easy to find compile time errors, such as null or undefined edge cases
* Tonnes of community support. There is a DefinitelyTypes npm package (and website) where you can find type definitions to the majority of the popular comunity project. If you take a look at our package.json file under devDependencies, you can see a number of these type definitions. They start with `@types`. 
* These are particularly helpful when the community documention is shit or often incomplete. Typescript add a additional layer of documention to our code.

If you go to any of our React components or community package in VSCODE and `CMD` + `Click` it will take you the type definition of that code. Let's try this on our Polaris TestStyle component, first just hover over the component and it gives you some information about what it is, but if we `Cmd` + `Click` on the component you will see that TextStyle is a Stateless Functional Component that accepts a 2 props, `variation` and `children`. Finally, if we accidently type variation incorectly or apss it a prop of the wrong, say a number, our editor will warn us of this problem.

These <INSERT PROPER NAME FOR TYPE ERROR> dialogs are often long and difficult to read at first, but if you read them from the bottom up they are a little easier to digest.

### Excercise

Now let's see if you can do the same process for `CustomerShow`. You will need to:

1. Use Webgen to create a new component with the name `CustomerShow` in the Customers section, choose `function`
1. Add another Route to the Customers section of `/show` and point it to this new component
1. Consult the mock up for what Polaris components you will need and render them in your new component
1. Take a break

When we start again in 15 minutes we will go through the answer together, and additionally add editing cababilities using a package from quilt called `@shopify/react-form-state` and make our routes dynamic. If you finish ahead a time, you can explore the documentation and try to do this yourself.

* https://github.com/Shopify/quilt

### Solution

First thing we want to do is run our webgen command, I'm going to do this now.

`yarn create shopify component CustomerShow`

In `Customers/index.tsx` copy and paste the first route, change the `component` prop to CustomerShow for this new route. We need to import this component as well.

Change the path to javascript template literal using backticks, use `match.url` and append `/show`. 

`
path={${math.url}/show
`

Now go to your CustomerShow component, lets add our Polaris imports. Lets start with the Page and add our title of `Customer`. We also want to add the `breadcrumbs`, this is an array of `LinkActions`, these have a `content` property which is the visual link title as well as a `url` which is where the breadcrumb go when clicked.

If you go back to the browser, a breadcumb should show up that when clicked goes back to the CustomerIndex.

Next we want to add the Save button. In Polairs, we can see this is a `primaryAction`, lets just copy and paste that into our Page.

Next lets add the visual part of our Form, add the `FormLayout` and `TextFeild` to our Polaris import. Add 2 TextFields to the page, one with a label "first name" and the other with "last name".

We should get a type error for our missing `onChange` prop, let's fix this.

Go to the quilt package for Form State. We first need to install it, type the following in the terminal.

```ts
yarn add @shopify/react-form-state
```

import 'FormState' from '@shopify/react-form-state'

In order to use FormState, you want wrap your entire Page in the Component. Next we need to provide it initialValues for the form, lets add some mock data here.

```ts
FormState initialValues={{firstName: 'Tobi', fastName: 'lÃ¼kte'}} />
```

FormState uses a common pattern in React for composition called "RenderProp" or sometimes reffered to as "Child as function" components. Components using this pattern do not accept children in the normal way, but instead expect a function. Let's start by just adding this.

To run Javascript within JSX, we open a curly brace. Next, we are going to add a empty arrow function. Next add a return statement with our Page markup. You just added a RenderProp.

Now, the implementation of FormState is meant to abstract away the details of how to manage all the nitty gritty details of working with Forms and just give you what you need for your form. This information and functionality is accessed through the paramaters in your child function. We need `formDetails` so add that as the furst argument to the function.

We want to add types here, `CMD` + click on the formState type and we see that the FormDetails of type FormDetails and we can import that from the FormState package. This type is call a generic.

Generic is a way to make reusable components in typescript. You often need generic if you would like a single type (shape) that worked over a range of types. A generics type can accept a numbers of type parameter and output a type at the time the user consume the type. You will often see this type use in many of the community library typing.

Lets start by declaring an interface for Fields, this should contain all the key and value types of our fields.

First we have firstName of type string and lastName of types string.

Now we can use javascript destructing to pull our the things we need from our form.

If we click through to form detials again, we see there is a boolean from that tells us if we are submitting, and some FormData that has information if we have errors or the form is dirty, what we need is the fields. This is a collection of fieldDescriptors that have a name,initialValue, value and other information about each specific form field.

If we continue destruction our fields, we can pull firstName and lastName objects. We can spread all of these onto our TextField component because the props are the an exact match.

That is all we need to do to edit our FormField.

The last thing we want to do is make the links from CustomerIndex actually work, you will notice clicking on a customer goes to the NotFound page. Let's change the route from the `Customers/index.tsx` and chnage the path to the costomer show component from a static path to a dynmaic one, by adding a `:customerId` after the match.url.

Now when we go back to the customerindex and click a customer to go to our customer index page.

Thats it, we're done. Now let's data.
